# Features of our poultry systems
## Core Features
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Simple (MVP ‚Äì Minimum Viable Product)

 First, just get the servo motor to open/close the door using time scheduling (e.g., Python datetime).
	‚Ä¢	Connect servo ‚Üí GPIO pin
	‚Ä¢	Write a small Python script to rotate it at set times
	‚Ä¢	Test with a simple cardboard door before mounting the real one

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Safety (Limit Switches + Manual Control)

Once the basic open/close works:
	‚Ä¢	Wire the limit switches to GPIO ‚Üí so the motor stops when door is fully open/closed
	‚Ä¢	Add a manual push button override to test human control

üëâ This ensures the door won‚Äôt break and gives you backup control.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Status Indicators (LEDs + OLED)
	‚Ä¢	Add Green LED (door open) and Red LED (door closed)
	‚Ä¢	Connect OLED (I2C pins) ‚Üí display door status and maybe current time

üëâ This makes your project user-friendly and shows live feedback.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Features (Weather / Motion Sensors)
	‚Ä¢	Connect PIR motion sensor ‚Üí detect if chickens are near door before closing
	‚Ä¢	Optional: Add weather sensor or API ‚Üí so it won‚Äôt close if rain is detected early
	‚Ä¢	Display info on OLED

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Integration & Testing
	‚Ä¢	Mount the system on the actual poultry house door
	‚Ä¢	Run tests in the morning/evening for at least 1‚Äì2 weeks
	‚Ä¢	Fine-tune timings, motor power, and sensor placement

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Tips for Best Results
	‚Ä¢	Prototype indoors with LEDs + cardboard before using the real coop
	‚Ä¢	Document wiring clearly (draw diagrams or take pics)
	‚Ä¢	Test each module separately (servo alone, button alone, LEDs alone) before combining
	‚Ä¢	Plan for failures ‚Üí have manual door access in case system crashes
	‚Ä¢	Keep it modular ‚Üí so you can expand with Wi-Fi, camera, or weather API later
